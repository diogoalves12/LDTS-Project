## **LTDS - Minesweeper**

---
 This project is inspired by the classical Microsoft Minesweeper game, released in 1990. 
The main objective is to **reveal all the cells in the board that do not contain mines** without
uncovering the ones that have mines.
  
The game ends when the player successfully reveals all the cells that do not contain mines, achieving 
victory, or when a cell containing a mine is revealed, resulting in a loss.
